# Case Studies In Networks

Welcome to the 'case studies in networks' GitHub page. Here you will find links to resources for this course --- links to papers I mention, helpful books and software packages. In addition, you will find the slides in the main folder on the morning of the course.

The coding content of this will be done through R. Before starting the course; it would be good to download the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). I have provided a video on setting up R and Rstudio here to make things a little easier [[here](https://youtu.be/KBgobghc-_4)]. 

This GitHub repository can be downloaded as a zip file to have all the content in one place by clicking on the green 'code' button and then selecting 'download zip'. I will be updating the code and slides before the course, so maybe leave this step until the morning of the course.

Talk soon.
